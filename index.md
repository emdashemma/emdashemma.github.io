I'm Emma. I just finished my MLIS at the University of Washington and relocated (returned!) to NYC to start a job at the New York Public Library. I have a background in performing arts administration, a professional bent for digital preservation and metadata, and side loves for baroque music + baking. I'm trying to practice my \~casual professional discourse\~ by writing up some recent/current projects, including:
<br>(1) cataloging Mozart shellac 78s for my capstone,
<br>(2) developing an optical media imaging workflow for an internship,
<br>(3) an independent study of the history of music printing technologies,
<br>(4) ongoing work with classial music metadata and the Vocal Music Instrumentation Index, and 
<br>(5) generally becoming an \~information professional\~ with coherent interests and skills.
