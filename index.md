I'm Emma, a second-year MLIS student at the University of Washington.
The goal here is to document a few projects in progress right now,
including (1) cataloging Mozart shellac 78s for my capstone,
(2) developing an optical media imaging workflow for an internship,
(3) independent study of the history of music printing technologies,
(4) ongoing work with classial music metadata and the Vocal Music
Instrumentation Index, and (5) generally becoming an \~information
professional\~ with coherent interests and skills.
