## Independent study, week 4

This week I continued reading about the era of printing and publishing music from moveable type, which is, very roughly, the seventeenth century. To an even greater extent than I understood from my research last quarter, the technologies of production really overlap and coexist, sometimes even within the same volumes. Not only will a typeset volume have woodblock capitals or illustrations, or perhaps—going in the other direction—an engraved title page, but I have come across a volume where the entire score is printed with single-impression moveable type except a tempest scene, in the middle of Act II, because there are TOO MANY FAST NOTES. It’s evident from the music itself that this scene simply could not be rendered with the fount of musical type available, so other arrangements had to be made. Unfortunately it’s not a score that UW has, but the entire volume is digitized and available on the University of North Texas Libraries website and I think this will be a perfect volume to pull into my paper. Not only was it published by Christophe Ballard, but the first edition was printed in 1689, the same year that Ballard printed Atys. I had no evidence that Ballard ever printed from engraved plates, and it hasn’t been mentioned in any reading I have done, so I’m excited to dive into that question further.

I also visited Special Collections this week and spent a few hours with the first set of materials from the Crawford Collection. These included the earliest item in the collection, Palestrina’s 1586 _Il secondo libro de madrigali a quatro voci_, which consists of four separate part-books sewn into thick paper wrappers (described as “possibly original” in the Sotheby’s auction catalog, which was excerpted in the research notes that I read in the Crawford papers last week). I found it interesting that the signature marks were continuous throughout the four parts (i.e. the soprano part starts with signature A, the alto part with signature D, the tenor with G, and the bass with K), which indicates that these separate volumes were handled in the printing process as a single unit, then sewn separately because of the demands of use: each singer would need their separate part.

I also had the fun surprise of coming across an entire packet of Crawford’s notes and letters in the score of _La clemenza di Tito_ that I was studying. I had read in Judy Tsou’s _Notes_ article that these research materials, along with other inserts like magazine clippings, performance programs, and ticket stubs had been unexpected discoveries in processing the collection and had been removed and organized into various subseries in the Crawford papers. It seems like this one volume was missed, and it likely has not been perused since it was acquired. Since the collection is in the Music Library’s area—despite being housed in Special Collections—I reached out to the head of the music library about the papers and I hope I might see them added into the appropriate folders of the accessioned papers.
