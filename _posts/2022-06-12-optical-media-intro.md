## Optical media workflow: intro üíø

This and upcoming posts are adapted from my final project presentation for the [2021-22 Dirks Preservation Internship](https://www.lib.washington.edu/preservation/preservation-services/dirks-intern) at the UW Libraries. My project was to research and make recommendations for a unified workflow for imaging optical media formats from Special Collections, which entailed first learning how CDs work, then researching available tools and workflows at other institutions to determine processing and metadata specifications for batch-creating disk images of various optical media formats, ensuring reasonable levels of quality control and consistent technical metadata.

To orient‚Äîwhy this project? It was one of several options that my supervisor suggested in the winter, occupying that sweet spot of being 1) educational, 2) appropriately scoped for ten weeks, and 3) useful to the department. I actually chose the CD project because I didn‚Äôt care about CDs: I thought, well, CDs are not old enough to be archivally sexy, and I‚Äôm not old enough to have had a really formative nostalgic experience with a CD collection‚Äîbut they *do* show up all over libraries and are at an important lifespan moment for preservation, so I figured it would be valuable to develop that knowledge and proficiency. 

Obviously, I _now_ think that CDs are interesting, but not having that nostalgia or familiarity has given me an appreciation for the role that kind of knowledge can have in this work. I loved hearing my colleagues tell stories about particular formats‚Äîwhether submitting audition recordings on Zip disk, or dashboard-baking CDs‚Äîand I‚Äôve started asking people about those kinds of relationships that they have to different media, realizing how much the physical format and encoding mechanisms of those media are not just relevant to the specialist recovering data from them. They become these culturally embedded technologies in ways that are intrinsically related to their materiality and to the particular affordances of that format, and I think there‚Äôs a lot to learn from that kind of specific object memory.

I'm going to start with the bibliography, since it was a research-first project, then post _Part I: What's optical media_ and _Part II: Developing the workflow_, which will link once they exist. My thinking this quarter has really been inflected by reading Matthew Kirschenbaum's [_Mechanisms_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/mechanisms), as well as working simultaneously with a bunch of other formats that present their materiality in different ways, specifically the disky-but-literal shellac sound recordings of my [Capstone project](https://emdashemma.github.io/2022/04/18/openrefine.html) and the really different realm of encoding represented by music notation technologies in the [independent study](https://emdashemma.github.io/2022/05/17/600-week-7.html).
