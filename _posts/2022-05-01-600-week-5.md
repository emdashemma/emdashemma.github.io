## Independent study, week 5

This week, I transitioned from the more chronological set of readings that I had arranged for the first four weeks into a more research-driven exploration. I was able to find a fully digitized version of the [first edition of Collasse’s _Thétis et Pélée_,](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b90627712/f2.item) the Ballard publication with one engraved scene interpolated in an otherwise typeset volume—the edition I had found last week was [the second, from 1716](https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc4/m1/9/). After going through the plates carefully to compare, I noticed that, beyond revisions to the pagination and signature marks, there were numerous changes to the plates, from the more aesthetic—a reformatting of the scene headers with decorative separations (even where it squishes close to the music)—to the orthographic: the intervening 30 years were apparently a period when French spelling modernized significantly, and there are several consistent edits, like replacing an _s_ with a circumflex in words like _nostre_ → _nôtre_, distinguishing between _i_ and _j_ (_j’adore_ instead of _I’adore_), and the modern spellings _croies_ → _croyez_, _voy_ → _vois_, and so on. It’s fascinating that these single objects—unique copper music plates—could physically embody these linguistic changes, which I tend to think of as more abstract and gradual.

Following references in some reading that I had done already, I acquired a few new volumes from the Music Library, including the International Association of Music Libraries’ _Guide for Dating Early Published Music_, which is fun for taking a rather practical and material approach to the products of the historical period in question, as well as _Four Hundred Years of Music Printing_, a slim volume from the British Museum, and _Print Culture and Music in Sixteenth-Century Venice_, which I haven’t started yet. I also have a _Traité historique et critique sur l’origine et les progrès des caractères de fonte pour l’impression de la musique_—my French is decent if slow, and this is a fascinating contemporary account (1765) from a typographer who knew many of the shops and characters he writes about.

On Friday in Special Collections, I compared different technologies of the same scores: Gluck’s _Alceste_ in typeset Italian edition (1769) and engraved French edition (1776), as well as Mozart’s _Clemenza di Tito_ both engraved and typeset. Something that I have noticed across these comparisons of multiple editions is that the advent of engraving technology led to stylistic changes that then influenced even volumes produced with older technologies. For example, the ease with which long curving shapes could be engraved on a plate seems to have led to the widespread use of left-edge braces to mark systems—that is, however many individual staves went together as a single moment of music (anywhere from two to ten, depending on how many people were singing or playing) would be bracketed together to indicate the coherence. This greatly increased the legibility of the score, and later typeset volumes adopt the feature, even though, with moveable type, a brace is rendered in multiple separate pieces of type and looks a little awkward. A clear illustration of this interplay between design and production is the _Thétis_ score, where the first edition has no braces—not even in the engraved scene, where they would have been simple to draw in—while the second edition has had braces added to the plates and to the typeset pages throughout: by 1726 they had clearly been adopted as house style even by the Ballard firm, which was notoriously old-fashioned.
