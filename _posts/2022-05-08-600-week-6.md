## Independent study, week 6

This week I learned more about printing music from engraved plates. While the earliest known example of intaglio engraving is from 1446, the use of copper plates for printing music appeared only in the early 17th century, first in England and the Netherlands, and not in France until 1660 (Krummel & Sadie, 1980). As it did for moveable type, _Music Printing and Publishing_ provided a detailed technical description of the process, which was very helpful to bring to my study of the Crawford materials. I was particularly interested to learn about the error correction process:

>“For correction, the plate was rested on the edge of the bench, between the arms of correcting callipers, each of which carried a point turned inwards at its end. The point of the arm over the face of the plate was placed on the character to be changed and pressed down: the point of the arm resting on the bench under the plate met it and located the position of the fault through the metal. The mark on the back was ringed, the plate was turned over face down on the stone and the area around the error was struck with a dot punch.” (46-47)

I was surprised to read about some of the drawbacks of printing from engraved plates. Much of the writing about the later typeset music works focuses on Ballard’s unsightly, old-fashioned moveable type and highlights the aesthetic primacy of engraving, but the technology itself only replaced one set of complications with another. Although plates could easily be stored for future use—reducing the publisher’s gamble of how large a print run to issue before distributing type—depending on the quality and alloy of the metal, plates might wear out after 200 to 500 pulls. And maybe “easily” is an overstatement: the engraved tempest scene in last week’s Collasse score actually has two fewer pages in the second edition, the last two plates apparently lost in the intervening years, and rendered instead (and less effectively, with a few final runs of quick notes) in moveable type! Also, Lenneberg (2003) points out that the printing process was slow, “since each sheet had to be moistened and then cranked through the rolling press and hung up to dry… Furthermore, the paper for engraving was heavier than that for letterpress and was nearly twice as costly” (105).

I spent most of Friday with the engraved 1767 edition of Handel’s _Messiah_, puzzling over the weird numbering of the plates. The volume has continuous pagination in the upper outer corners of the plates, but there were also parenthesized numbers centered at the bottom of many plates, which increased steadily but did not occur on each page—that is, both numbering styles began at 1, and lined up until 10, but then the plate numbers paused until page 18 where they picked back up at 11, no longer lined up with the page numbers. I wondered if this was evidence of certain numbers added later, or multiple engravers working separately, but the reused Collasse plates had been renumbered, so why were contradictory sequences retained here? I went through Part I and noted by movement where the plate numbers disappeared, and it seemed that arias had them while choruses lacked them. Crawford’s catalog of the collection had a note citing William C. Smith’s _Handel, A Descriptive Catalog of the Early Editions_, so I went to the Music Library and there it was: this is the first complete edition of the work, but the _Songs in Messiah_ had been printed much earlier, in 1749, and Smith confirms that the same plates were reused. Perhaps the original numbers were not effaced because Songs was a popular volume itself, and went through additional editions after the full score (these latter additions then also having the full score’s numbering, which, without the choruses, would skip).

In hindsight, the explanation seems obvious, but it’s fascinating to see in action how the different printing technologies leave completely different patterns of evidence—the kinds of errors and omissions and traces of activity that you get from an engraved volume are distinct from those in a manuscript or a typeset volume. It will be useful to continue reading the _Guide for Dating Early Published Music_ as well, since that book includes many such observations of what details to look for.
