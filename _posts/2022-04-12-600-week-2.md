## Independent study, week 2

<img src="https://github.com/emdashemma/emdashemma.github.io/blob/main/uploads/bell_monks.jpeg" width="200" align="right">This week, I surveyed the beginning of the history of music notation. (Or, rather, the beginning of what evolves contiguously into modern Western music notation—there are a few instances of Babylonian and Ancient Greek notation, but they are ambiguous, and the practice disappears for almost a millennium.) Nicolas Bell’s brief volume _Music in Medieval Manuscripts_ describes the beginning of music notation in the early ninth century, when marks called neumes begin to appear in liturgical texts to indicate the contours of chant melodies. Neumes do not designate length or absolute pitch, but rather melodic intervals or small patterns of notes. There was a strong oral tradition of chant within the monastic communities of the European church, and this notation was merely an aide-mémoire—you couldn’t have deciphered it without knowing the melody already. _Music in Medieval Manuscripts_ is full of color reproductions of manuscripts, which show the variety of evolving practices in music notation (idiosyncratic approaches like different colored inks to indicate relative durations, a single guiding staff line, and so on), as well as the illustrations of musicians and musical instruments that appear in illuminated art throughout surviving manuscripts of the same period. Bell cautions that these are not historically accurate—illustrators were sometimes trying to depict what they imagined Biblical instruments would have looked like—but they still offer glimpses of performance practice, like three monks singing from a single scroll, which is notated in the image with a recognizable chant (Arundel MS 83, f. 63v, in Bell on p. 47 (here, above)).

Deeming’s (2006) article, [“Observations on the habits of twelfth- and thirteenth-century music scribes,”](https://www.persee.fr/doc/scrip_0036-9772_2006_num_60_1_3918) was an excellent supplement to Bell’s survey, zooming in on the difficulties that this new technology of notation posed for a music scribe faced with a blank page. From a sample of 12th- and 13th-century notated manuscripts, Deeming observes that music notation tended to be added after the text, sometimes by a different scribe, and often suffering from a poor guess of how much space it would take up. Inconsistent ruling schemes across pages show that scribes were often adapting to the space left to them, for example, using two columns if the text were set thus, then switching to a single, more legible line of music if they had been left an entire blank page for a set of chants. Deeming also addressed the use of the rastrum, a multi-nibbed pen or device capable of holding multiple pens or quills together in order to draw the lines (for plainchant, four, rather than the modern five) of the staff—consistent spacing and wobbles across all four lines are strong clues for this practice, which continued and came up in my Lully research last quarter as well.

Lenneberg’s history starts later, since it concerns publishing rather than just notation (_On the Publishing and Dissemination of Music, 1500-1850_). He situates early distribution of notated music in a broader cultural space, from patterns of music commissioning and collecting  in the sixteenth century—a sort of private economy of music transmission among the nobility—to the difficulty of establishing prices across currencies of this period. The question of cost is quite important in determining the evolution of music notation, since economic viability determines the adoption and survival of various technologies and modes of production. Lenneberg observes that, unlike for something like a Bible, demand for a single volume of printed music could rarely be sufficient to warrant its printing, even once that technology was available, so determining the relative costs of manuscript and printing is a different calculation here than for text.

Finally, I visited Special Collections to view the William Crawford III papers, which came to the Libraries along with the collection of scores that I will be studying this quarter. Crawford conducted extensive research and correspondence related to his collecting activities, so there’s a wealth of contextual information for all of the scores. The papers’ organization is a little challenging, because it is primarily by work (rather, by surname of composer of work), but there are also folders organized by correspondent (e.g. dealer, conservator, reference librarian), so I need to go through those all as well to make sure I’m not missing anything about the volumes that I’m interested in. (For example, I found the response to Crawford’s inquiry about another edition of Atys in the “L” folder, under “Lully,” but his inquiry is in an “N” folder, as a letter sent to “Neighbor, Tim,” a friend and correspondent at the British Library.) I’m going to return this week to continue reading.
