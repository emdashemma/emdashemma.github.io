## Independent study, week 7

I did my planned readings this week on lithography and the printing processes of the nineteenth century, but I also stayed in the seventeenth century to do more Lully & Ballard research for my paper. I don’t think it’s just the intrigue of the old that makes the earlier materials more interesting objects of study here—even in the very detailed Krummel & Sadie (1980) handbook, the story gets a little vaguer as it goes on. For the suite of lithograph technologies, a wide variety of chemical and material combinations can accomplish the basic process of selectively inking a flat stone (hence _litho-_, although it can be another material) where the design has been drawn, then transferring that ink to paper, and the various processes are not distinguishable in their end products. It seems that, as the technologies achieve more perfectly their goal of efficiently (economically) producing more—and more exact—copies of musical works, the product is less inflected by materiality of that process, so there is less to say about the one in hand. I’ll be curious to see if this plays out when I look at the more modern materials from the Crawford collection, but I played a concert today, in a community orchestra, and I considered our printed music as a marvel of reproduction—easy to perform from, I mean, and relatively affordable—but not something that revealed much about its creation.

Evidence so often takes the form of deviation from the ideal—I think of the slight hyphenation that gives away moveable-type staves, with type characters worn slightly at the edges that don’t join up, or the blind impression of the engraved plate’s edges in paper thick enough to sustain the printing process—so with the improving technologies there is a dwindling body of evidence. In the Lully scores, on the other hand, there is such a wealth of evidence, occasionally to the point of dramatic deviations from the ideal! I was comparing a facsimile copy (in print, from the Music Library) and a full-color digital scan of the first printed edition of _Achille et Polyxène_, the opera Lully was writing when he died (it was finished by his protégé), and found a page where the full-color image had a weird box around two half-staves: it was a pasted-in correction, on paper that had toned more quickly than the original. The same edit had been made to the copy in facsimile, but it hadn’t been apparent in the black and white rendering, except for the staff extending a little too far into the margin, which I hadn’t noticed on its own. It’s remarkable to be able to compare copies like this, which are both from the same 1687 printed edition—and seemingly repaired in-house by the printer before being sold (because the typography of the correction matches)—but which are being rendered through different modern reproductive technologies that are emphasizing or suppressing certain characteristics (color, three-dimensionality, etc.). I think that I am pursuing a sort of descriptive or analytical bibliography of these materials, and it’s the weird, inconsistent, and inexplicable that is the most exciting, because it becomes so much clearer in those moments that a specific person in contingent circumstances made this—even made it badly and then had to figure out how to fix it—and left these specific traces of evidence.
