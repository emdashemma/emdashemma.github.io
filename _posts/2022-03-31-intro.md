## The overview

### (1) Cataloging Mozart 78s for Capstone

For my MLIS Capstone project, I'm working with the Head of Monographic Cataloging at the UW Libraries to do original item cataloging for a historic collection of Mozart sound recordings on 78 rpm shellac discs. The [Offenbacher Mozart Collection](https://www.lib.washington.edu/music/specialcollections/mozart) at the University of Washington Libraries is a unique collection of over 1500 historic sound recordings, primarily on 78rpm shellac discs, of the vocal works of W.A. Mozart.

It's been exciting and challenging to work with these rare materials from the acoustic recording era, which are from early enough in the record industry to be wildly unstandardized. I am working in OCLC Connexion to do both copy and original cataloging: to my surprise, working with copy has been the more complex process, since it often involves updating old AACR2 records to RDA and assessing unattributed statements with external research (bracketed but unsubstantiated publication or recording dates, for instance).

## (2) Developing an optical media preservation workflow

I'm the 2021-22 James Leland Dirks, Jr. Preservation Intern at the University of Washington Libraries. This is a year-long opportunity to work alongside Preservation staff, learning and assisting with workflows from pamphlet binding and bibliographic collation to commercial binding and integrated pest management, digitization, and more.

For my spring quarter project, I'm doing a lot of research and attempting to develop a unified workflow for preserving optical media formats in the Libraries' Special Collections. TBD whether this is disk imaging ... \[to be continued\]
